Breif Description about Real-Time Embedded Systems

Real-time systems are computer systems that monitor, respond to, or control an external environment. 
This environment is connected to the computer system through sensors, actuators, and other input-output interfaces.

Applications:

vehicle systems for automobiles, subways, aircraft, railways, and ships
traffic control for highways, airspace, railway tracks, and shipping lanes
process control for power plants, chemical plants, and consumer products such as soft drinks and beer
medical systems for radiation therapy, patient monitoring, and defibrillation
military uses such as firing weapons, tracking, and command and control
manufacturing systems with robots
telephone, radio, and satellite communications
computer games
multimedia systems that provide text, graphic, audio, and video interfaces
household systems for monitoring and controlling appliances
building managers that control such entities as heat, lights, doors, and elevators
